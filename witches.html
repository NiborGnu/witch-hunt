                    The intense period of witch trials known as "the big uproar" started in Dalarna,
                    where Gertrud Svensdotter, who was accused of walking on water in 1667, singled
                    out Märit Jonsdotter from Lillhärdal as her teacher. Since the minutes from the
                    trial in Lillhärdal are very long as the legal process took several years, we
                    have selected parts of the text. <br> Read through the protocol and see what Märit,
                    who was called Stor[Big]-Märit to distinguish her from her sister of the same name,
                    Lill[Little]-Märit, was accused of and what she tells herself. <br>

                            On September 28, Gertrud Svensdotter and a stranger, 17-year-old Anna Oloffsdotter, came
                            from Loka in Älvdalen, to Lillhärdal parish. Both have previously confessed. Anna has
                            never been in Lillhärdal previously. The court asks them if they recognized this
                            Stor-Märit Jonsdotter. Gertrude answered that Stor-Märit had been her teacher and that
                            she had ridden with her many times Blue hill. The other, Anna Olofsdotter, said that she
                            cannot know for sure if she knows Stor-Märit or not because she has never here on earth
                            seen her ever before. Therefore convened six of the neighbor maids here in the village,
                            namely Margreta Persdotter, Kirstin and Märit Mattsdotter, Märit Olofsdotter, Märit
                            Larsdotter and Elin Persdotter, who were the same age as the infamous Stor-Märit
                            Jonsdotter. All were bareheaded and gathered together in a group. After this were
                            allowed to go one by one to a small square window, 2½ blocks in size [about 37 cm],
                            where Anna Olofsdotter stood alone. When the maids arrived one by one, Anna said that "I
                            don't know that one", "No the” and so on. But when Stor-Märit came, Anna replied that "I
                            have seen her many times in Blåkulla, sitting on the bench among the foremost at the
                            high seat". Gertrud told the same thing, that she saw that Stor-Märit went with Satan to
                            the chamber and into the bed where she committed fornication with him. After this, Satan
                            had come out and put on Stor-Märit two large horns that reached all the way up to the
                            roof and danced with her.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lill-Märit Jonsdotter and her brothers, Olof and Jon Jonsson, was called to
                            Länsmansgården. The were interrogated one by one in a chamber in Gertrud and Anna's
                            presence. Although these three hard-hearted persons were tried to be induced to confess,
                            even with God the almighty gracious help, they refused. In the end, the obstinacy was
                            softened and they prayed together to God that the evil one the spirit would leave them.
                            After the prayer, they burst into tears and confessed that they had been there quite
                            often Blue hill. Little Mary had been misled by Big Mary. Olof and Jon had been misled
                            by the father, Jon Skomakare who lived here in Lillhärdal parish, but who had died two
                            years ago in Särna parish in Dalarna where he then lived and worked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These siblings, Lill-Märit, Olof and Jon, fully admit that Satan had strong
                            power over them and with threats prevented them from telling about their
                            own or others' association with him. The siblings tells us that Stor-Märit
                            is even more employed by Satan and has a stronger covenant with him. She
                            has been in his service for a long time and the siblings fear that she will
                            confess sooner or later. The who are still young or those who are old, who
                            have served Satan for a long time, find it easier to confess.
                            Those who are in their prime have a harder time getting rid of Satan.
                            After Little-Märit, Olof and Jon's confessions, Great-Märit Jonsdotter was
                            again brought in and told her what her carnal siblings had confessed,
                            both about themselves and about her, how how many times she had been in
                            Blåkulla, how often Lill-Märit had seen her fornicate with Satan and also
                            how she saw Stor-Märit dancing with the big horns on her. Stor-Märit recoiled
                            from this and did not allow himself to be influenced in the slightest but
                            continues to deny and claims that the siblings are lying and do not know
                            what they have confessed. Stor-Märit believes that the siblings have now
                            abandoned God and been led into evil the road. The siblings fell into tears
                            over Stor-Märit's stubbornness, took Stor-Märit in their arms and asked her to
                            The name of Jesus drive Satan away and become a child of God.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the court, despite persistent struggle both worldly and spiritual,
                            cannot persuade Stor-Märit to come to any true confession, despite this,
                            a number of strong proofs can be attached to her: 1. That she has been
                            Gertrud Svensdotter's teacher, as the research in Älvdalen shows, and also Gertrud
                            herself orally tells; 2. Stor-Märit could be singled out by Anna Olofsdotter from
                            Älvdalen out of a group with six other people that Anna has never seen. Anna had
                            never been to Lillhärdal but recognized StorMärit from Blåkulla. 3. Although
                            Stor-Märit did not confess, her three siblings, Little-Märit, Olof and Jon
                            told that Stor-Märit had ridden Per Tholsson's and Halfwar Swensson's cows to
                            death during journeys to Blåkulla. The journeys were often made together with
                            the siblings 4. There, Big-Märit has since committed fornication, according to
                            LittleMärit, five times with Satan and Gertrud and Anna can also tell this.
                            Stor-Märit refuses despite the testimonies. 5. There is a small scar in Stor-Märit's
                            left little finger, where Satan marked her and others the first time they came to
                            Blåkulla. 6. Stor-Märit admits that she can read salt and cast spells [so that the
                            sorcerous person could put disease on other people]. So because of for the
                            aforementioned reasons, the court cannot exempt Stor-Märit from the death penalty,
                            but she is sentenced to death according to Sweden's law 15th, 13th and 6th chapters
                            of the Högmålsbalken and the Västerås statute on signery [trolldom]. Also according
                            to the law of God, Exodus [Book of Exodus] ch. 22 verse 182, Levitius [Leviticus] ch.
                            20 verse 273 and Micah [Mika] ch. 5 verse 124. Her sibling, Lill-Märit, is also
                            sentenced in the same way. Olof and Jon who have confessed, to death according to the
                            above-mentioned chapters in God's law and Sweden's law.

                    The largest witch trial in Sweden took place in 1674 in Torsåker parish, Ångermanland.
                    When the trial was finished, 71 people, 65 of whom were women, had been sentenced to
                    death. Elisabetta, aged 24, was one of these. The one who led the trial was the

                            October 30 Erich Hansson from Nääs, wife Elisabetta, 24, was summoned to court. Because she
                            couldn't persuaded to confess the crime, the following witnesses were called, namely: The
                            boy Jon Andersson in Nordanåker, 14 years old, who says that Elisabetta, son
                            matmother [lady of the house], brought him to Blåkulla every night during this summer with
                            the help of people and livestock [which they thus travelled/ridden on]. As compensation he
                            had received 1 Riksdaler, 1 silver spoon and 1 gold spoon from her. He had also received
                            food from her. He has there read from 3 ½ books with curses on Jesus, the Carpenter's son,
                            memory and mind, father and mother and everything under heaven, except the magpie and the
                            bumblebee. There he has saw her weaving and frying the sausages, lying with Satan under the
                            table and committing fornication with him, she has also eaten, drunk and danced there. Every
                            night she brings grain from her neighbor to Blåkulla and burns it up. She brings her own
                            infant in her lap and sex other children in the back of the vehicle. Sahra Persdotter from
                            Nääs, 9 years old, certifies that Elisabetta every night from midsummer has brought
                            her to Blåkulla with the help of people and livestock. As compensation, she had received 3
                            riksdaler and food to eat. She has there read 2 books full of curses like her enumerates.
                            Elisabetta weaves, roasts sausages, pork and meat. Elisabetta brings grain and
                            burning it. She then dances and goes under the table to Satan and commits fornication with
                            him. Kneeled before him and said, Jesus in heaven help me so that I don't admits. During the
                            night that was, Satan gave Elisabetta a red and a gray ribbon around her the neck as a means
                            of remaining strong. She then promised never to confess as long as she lived.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The boy Olle in Nääs, 6 years old, says that Elisabetta brought him to Blåkulla
                            every night with the help of people and livestock. He has received a piece of gold from her
                            and food to eat. Read in 2 books with curses. There she roasts the pork and the sausage and
                            weaves. She brings grain and burns it. Jon in Nordanåker also certifies that Elisabetta
                            also took Olof Ersson's children with her in Kerstin in Lästadh, Elisabetta's sisters,
                            Bryta in Hammar, Anna in Åhlestadh and Segridh in Nääs, all confess
                            unanimously that this Elisabetta served from childhood Satan and with him committed
                            fornication and worshiped him as their god. Finally, some boys tell that an angel has
                            appeared to the Thing. Then Elisabetta bursts into tears and admits that the children who
                            testified have told the truth. She has worshiped Satan as her god and committed fornication
                            with him. In his service, she has woven and fried sausages in Blåkulla. She blames her
                            mother for bringing her to Blåkulla in her childhood. She has read from Satan 7 books with
                            curses on God, his word and all who live on earth and so on. She has been married to Satan
                            and had two children with him that her mother chopped up and threw into a cauldron. The
                            children have been boiled down for anointing [an ointment could be made from, among other
                            things, boiled baby fat spread on what would be used as a vehicle to get to Blåkulla,
                            cattle, sticks or the like] and then kept in a horn that her mother gave her 9 years
                            ago. Since then, Elisabetta has used it herself and kept it in her clothes on the left side
                            under her chest. Elisabetta's mother has since taken the horn. Elisabetta promises to stick
                            to her confession and serve the right god. He gives her his gentle grace and blessing. 31
                            October Erich Hansson's i Nää's wife, Elisabetta, stands by her confession as she did
                            yesterday.

                    The one who led the trial and conducted the interrogations was the priest Nils Edenius.
                    The first person to be held accountable was the 13-year-old girl Margreta Nilsdotter. <br>

                            Nils Jacobsson and Sund's daughter, Margreta Nilsdotter, 13, were brought before the
                            court.
                            She confessed voluntarily that she was brought to Blåkulla by Sockenstugu‐Sara for the
                            first
                            time last spring. During midsummer, the wife Sara Ersdotter, who lived in the parish
                            cottage, began to smear (an ointment could be made from, among other things, boiled baby
                            fat
                            spread on what you wanted use as a vehicle to get to Blåkulla, livestock, sticks or the
                            like) for Margreta and taught her to ride. From the beginning, Margreta brought Lasse, a
                            little boy in Sund, with her, since then she has always ridden herself, sometimes on a
                            cane
                            and sometimes on a chalkboard that her wife Sara had anointed for her. Margaret has
                            received
                            a silver spoon from his wife Sara, been married twice in Blåkulla, had two children with
                            Per
                            Ersson's boy Erich in Sätra. Satan soon took these children and purged them as great
                            frogs,
                            chopped them up and boiled them for anointing. This he then distributed to the witches.
                            Margreta also got some of this, but she doesn't want to admit that she has self
                            lubricated.
                            However, she finally confesses that last summer she had the horn with anointing during
                            the
                            nights when Satan himself had awakened her and they had gone away.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The wife Sara has served Satan for as long as she can remember and she has brought this
                            with
                            her Margreta in Sundh to Satan. She has also brought Lasse i Sundh, Erich, Brijta and
                            Elisabeth in Sätra, Olle, Johan, Karin and Kirstin at Kyrckiobohle and a young boy,
                            Jonas in
                            Sit down. She can't remember when she started bringing the children with her. She also
                            confessed that these listed are witches, namely: Olof Nilsson's wife Sara in Siölandh,
                            Simon
                            Hindersson's wife Kierstin in Skåfwe, wife Brijta in Dynääs, Matz Nilsson's wife
                            Elisabeth
                            in Hiältsta and the maid Malin in Nääs. Since the wife Sara confessed, Satan has got
                            hold of
                            her and wanted to throw her into the cauldron, but with God's help she escaped from
                            there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The wife Sara now voluntarily admits that she has helped Satan by sawing the chain he is
                            bound with. She also wants to admit that she committed fornication with Satan but says
                            that
                            she would not be allowed to admit it to Satan. Satan has pretended to be the right
                            savior
                            and Christ and expects to receive as many souls as Jesus. On that occasion he appears in
                            a beautiful and powerful figure together with his fellow gods. Already as a child she has
                            been taken to Blåkulla by his life mother Jon Michelsson's wife Elin in Kiäxe who died 80
                            years
                            ago. With tears in her eyes, she voluntarily confessed that she has served Satan all her
                            days. She now thanked God that through the admonitions of the Court and the ministry of
                            preaching I have now been enlightened and led onto the right path. She regretted her
                            wayward
                            ways. The wife Sara prays that God will help the girl Margreta from Satan's net.
                            Margreta's
                            confession was very lame and silly and she couldn't tell much. The ministry wanted to
                            hold
                            her under serious questioning and teaching about God's word and the right knowledge so
                            that she could be enlightened and led in on the path of bliss.
